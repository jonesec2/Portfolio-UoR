                <p>Hello, as you can see this website is about me, Christian Jones. I was born in Chesterfield, Virginia. I attended Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and earned my Bachelor of Arts degree. I married my college sweetheart and best friend after college, and we lived in Richmond for four years. However higher education called, and we moved to Greensboro, North Carolina so my wife could attain a master’s in education.</p>
                <p>My wife being the ever talented, and super genius, she finished school a semester early. We returned to Richmond after a year and a half, with an expensive piece of paper, and a baby on the way. Through a series of fortunate events, I was able to get a job testing software. I had no formal education, but working with others and teaching myself I learned. It was there that I found my aptitude for coding. I often found myself deep in the SQL sauce; joining table after table, with 'datediff's, 'group by', and 'havings' to recreate the scenarios I needed to test. And loving it.</p>
                <p>The baby is now a toddler, the cutest one that ever lived. And my wife is using her fancy piece of paper to work at VCU. Now it’s time to start my new chapter. I am eager to learn new skills, to further my career, but also as a way for artistic expression. I am inspired by my hobbies; videogames, movies, Dungeons and Dragons, and books. I can't wait to use my new skills to create a website for my D&D group or make a mod for my favorite game.</p>
                <p>Thanks for visiting my online Portfolio. Please check out my projects on the “Portfolio” page, and feel free to contact me with any inquiries about myself or my work.</p>
