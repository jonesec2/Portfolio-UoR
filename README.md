# Portfolio-UoR
Christian Jones Portfolio project

## Description
In order to communicate effectively with future employers, I need an online portfolio showcasing my work.

This repo will contain the portfolio in html/css form.

## Table of contents

## About_Me
This section of my portfolio will contain information about myself. A brief description, and a picture of yours truly. (me)

## Contact
This section of my portfolio will include information on how to get in contact with me, or leave me your own contact information. I look forward to hearing from you.

## Gallery
This section of my portfolio will showcase all the projects that I have created. Enjoy!

## Credits
As I continue this journey and collaberate with more collegues, I will add their names and contact info to this list.

For now I would like to think UoR Coding Boot camp instructors, John and Greg, and the TA's. As well as my supportive family.
